# GeologyBen

This repo is for Ben Mayor's Geology Blog

Currently it just contains wordpress themes for the blog. 

The classic theme folder is the most complete version, which I prefer as it offers much more customisation, however I began developing the block theme initially and left it here in case I return to it at any point.
